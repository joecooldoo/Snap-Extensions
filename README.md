<h1>Snap<i>!</i> Extensions</h1> <small>By Joecooldoo</small><br>
<br>
So recently, I have been working on on a thing called Snap<i>!</i> Extensions, and the first extension is out!

* [Cloud Variables](https://snap.berkeley.edu/snap/snap.html#present:Username=joecooldoo&ProjectName=Snap!%20Extensions) 
Why use these? Recently a whole bunch of other cloud variable servers stopped working. Here is a working version!
* [Scratch Cloud Variable Access](https://snap.berkeley.edu/snap/snap.html#present:Username=joecooldoo&ProjectName=Snap!%20Extensions) 
You can now access Cloud Variables from Scratch Projects!
* [Day Of Year](https://snap.berkeley.edu/snap/snap.html#present:Username=joecooldoo&ProjectName=Snap!%20Extensions) 
You can get the day of the year!
* [Replace Text!](https://snap.berkeley.edu/snap/snap.html#present:Username=joecooldoo&ProjectName=Snap!%20Extensions) 
Replaces the defined text in a phrase with the defined letter (or text)!
* [Detect Gibberish!](https://snap.berkeley.edu/snap/snap.html#present:Username=joecooldoo&ProjectName=Snap!%20Extensions) 
Keep spam away from your Snap<i>!</i> Projects!

Have fun!
